# gazepoint-psychophysio-demo
A series of pupillometry experiments using Gazepoint GP3 eye-tracking 
hardware. Includes a user interface for simple connect/disconnect and 
start/stop control of the GP3 eye-tracker and the experiment. As of this 
writing, the suite of demo experiments are fixation studies with auditory 
stimuli, designed to be versatile for applications measuring the pupil. The 
experimenter user interface and back-end are Matlab-based.
